# Readability Classification for Vietnamese Text 

This repository was developed as a project for the course **Introduction to Natural Language Processing**, focusing on the problem of Vietnamese text readability classification using pre-trained models, such as **PhoBERT** and **PhoGPT**.

- `phoBERT_0_feature.ipynb`: Fine-tuned the PhoBERT model to encode text, with the encoded output fed into an SVM classifier for readability classification.
- `phogpt_250_73.ipynb`: Fine-tuned the PhoGPT model to directly classify text readability.
